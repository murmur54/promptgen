## General info

A fantasy TTRPG prompt generator made as part of Codecademy portfolio. Currently generates random, stupid interactions between player characters and random, vague NPCs.
It's not my fault if this derails your campaign, I promise.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Setup

Code listed on Github is just the Javascript for the corresponding HTML page. It shouldn't be too hard to change to fit another site, or to make it run automatically / with a command prompt.

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development

- Generate really stupid fantasy prompts that don't really make sense but will make lots of antics for your games.
- Lock the parts of phrases that you like to see what else they can make.

To-do list:

- Different generators for weapons, enemies, magic, etc
- Wow improvement to be done 2

## Status

Project is: _in progress_,

Created by murmur54- I'll link it to something eventually, promise.
